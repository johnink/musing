<p>A great comedian once said, “What’s the deal with airline food?” And comedy was never the same. Live in the spirit of Jerry Seinfeld, and see if you can find “the deal.”</p>

<p>First find a prompt.</p>

<blockquote>Bread</blockquote>

<p>Then just start asking yourself what the deal with it is. If you get stuck, start over and take a different direction</p>

<blockquote>What’s the deal with bread? Squishy sponge with a burny outside? Dumb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>What’s the deal with bread? We just cut it and use it for handles on food. Eat your salad with a fork.</blockquote>
<blockquote>What’s the deal with bread? What’s the deal with bread?</blockquote>
<blockquote>What’s the deal with bread? Tortillas are so much better.</blockquote>
<blockquote>What’s the deal with bread? Hanzel and Grettle thought they could just leave it on the ground. It’s true.</blockquote>

<p>You’ll know when it’s time to try a new prompt… Keep exploring until you find an idea, then rewrite in your own words.</p>




<p>If you’ve already got a premise, sometimes it’s better to channel Chris Rock. Chris takes his premise and just repeats it, hammering it in. So, any time you get stuck, jump back to your premise.</p>

<blockquote>Tortillas are better than bread. Say “no” to the sponge. Say “yes” to a better food handle. Say “no” to Taco Bell, still. Say “yes” to drugs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tortillas are better than bread. Better than most things, but definitely better than bread. Can you imagine, italian food served with tortillas? Mmm...</blockquote>
<blockquote>Tortillas are better than bread.</blockquote>

<p>Think about what naysayers would say, and dispute them.</p>

<blockquote>You think your getting more food with bread, but it’s mostly hot air. Until it cools, then it’s just air in your food.</blockquote>

<p>You may be surprised at what you find.</p>
