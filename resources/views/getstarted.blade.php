<h3>Who we are.</h3>

<p>The beginning of all content is ideas, and sometimes it’s hard to keep finding the ideas that keep us driven. We want to help you learn how to play and explore to find those ideas, and provide tools to help when you get stuck. Omusing catalogs little improv games you can play by yourself in your free time to stimulate your imagination to help you find ideas, or, at the very least, help you think creatively.</p>

<p>You can start an account to save your favorite games and to comment on games, but it’s not necessary. We’re don’t aspire to be one of those websites. This site is a tool, please use it as you see fit.

<h3>What you’ll need…</h3>

<h4>A pocket notebook</h4>

<p>You never know when inspiration will strike. So, it’s important to be ready with paper. Moleskine notebooks are good for durability. Alternatively, you can use your smartphone.</p>

<h4>A pen</h4>

<p>Any old cheap pen will do. If you're an artist, and you think you’ll be sketching, maybe you’ll want something a little more fancy. You can also put a small pen on your keychain to make sure you always have it on hand.</p>

<h3>Advice...</h3>

<h4>Don’t follow rigidly</h4>

<p>Feel free to let your mind wander when you’re playing a game, it means you’ve found an interesting path. As long as you don’t start thinking about things you have to do today, or where you want to eat for lunch, you should be okay.</p>

<h4>Break the Rules</h4>

<p>Everything here is just a starting point. Break the rules, make up new ones, and come up with your own games. If you’ve come up with something that works, post it in the comments, or in the Reddit channel.

<h4>Wait before you Trash</h4>

<p>Don’t throw away your scrap paper right away. Come back to it later. Many times, something that seemed obvious initially will strike a chord later. Likewise, a good idea today may lose its charm quickly.</p>

<h4>Share</h4>

<p>There can be a fear around sharing your work. You might be afraid someone could steal it or just kill your passion for it. But, there’s a definite value to sharing whatever stupid thing you come up with. Many times, people will love an idea you almost threw away.</p>
