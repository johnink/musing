## musing 1.2.0

live at omusing.com

A website cataloging improvisational games you can play by yourself to come up with ideas.

Once website is installed, register a user called 'Admin' and type (host.com)/update to
upload all game data to the database. Also run this when you make any changes to the games
directory.

Games are held in public/games. They are made up of an info.json file (holds the info that
gets uploaded to the database on /update) and potentially a .js file that holds the widget.

Current features include the ability to add widgets to games. These widgets can be added to
a users homepage. From there, they can be bumped up or down the list, added or deleted.
These changes are reflected immediately in the database.
